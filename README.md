# Workflow

- You can create a toast message with background colors for warning, fail, and success, along with a message, and automatically hide it after some time. 
- To manage the position of toast messages (i.e., display them at the top or bottom of the screen), you can modify the y-coordinate of the toast label's frame.
- You can create an enum to represent different types of toast messages and pass that enum value when showing the toast message.
- To make the ToastType enum include a message associated with each case, you can define a message property for each enum case
